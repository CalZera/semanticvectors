#summary Predication Based Semantic Indexing - PSI

Predication-based Semantic Indexing, or PSI, is an application of distributional semantic techniques to reasoning and inference. 

PSI is integrated and available in SemanticVectors as of version 3.4, and works with real, binary, and complex vectors.

For now, to get it working, please see the example data and commands in the integration tests. Please contact the project if you would like better instructions ;)
