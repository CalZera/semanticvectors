#summary A list of research related to semantic vector spaces generally.

This is a large topic on which much has been written. There are many many more papers we should add here, please feel free to write in with suggestions. Or even better, join the project and start adding them yourself.

===Papers that talk about the SemanticVectors Package itself===

[http://www.puttypeg.com/papers/semanticvectors.v2.pdf Semantic Vectors: A Scalable Open Source Package and Online Technology Management Application]. Dominic Widdows, Kathleen Ferraro, 2008.

Empirical Distributional Semantics: Methods and Biomedical Applications. Trevor Cohen, Dominic Widdows, Journal of Biomedical Informatics (2009) (to appear).

===Papers that use the SemanticVectors Package to generate results===

_Please let us know if you have any articles to add to this list, it is really good for the project to know what results people have obtained using the software._
