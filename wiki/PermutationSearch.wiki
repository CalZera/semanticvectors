#summary Permutation and Directional Indexing and Search
= Permutation Indexing and Search =

The technique of using vector coordinate permutations (also interpreted as rotations) to investigate the effect of word order on vector semantics has recently been introduced by [http://www.sics.se/~mange/papers/permutationsCogSci08.pdf Sahlgren, Holst & Kanerva (2008)].

To build a permutation or directional index, follow the instructions for building PositionalIndexes, but using the additional command line option `-indextype permutation` or `-indextype directional`. A permutation index encodes the position of each term relative to each other term within a sliding window, while a directional index encodes whether a term occurs before or after each other term in this sliding window. The directional approach was first used in Burgess and Lund's HAL model. 

To search, use the normal Search program with the option `-searchtype PERMUTATION` (and use the options '-q randomvectors.bin' and  `-s permtermvectors.bin` to tell the search to use the default output of BuildPositionalIndex). Query syntax uses a question mark "?" character to denote the target location, so that (e.g.) a search for "Martin ? King" would ideally return the result "Luther". Only one question mark per query is permitted in the current implementation.

Here are a few examples, drawn from Jones and Mewhort (2007) and Sahlgren (2008) generated using the TASA corpus, which was kindly provided by Tom Landauer.
