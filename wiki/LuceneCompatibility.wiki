#summary Compatibility between Apache Lucene and SemanticVectors

SemanticVectors depends on Apache Lucene, but not with all versions of Apache Lucene.

SV version 1.30 and higher works with Lucene 3.0 and higher, but not with Lucene 2.X.

SV version 1.26 and earlier works with Lucene versions greater than 2.2.0 and higher, but not with Lucene 3.0.

SV version 2.0 works with Lucene 3.0.3.

We will try to keep up-to-date with new Lucene versions, please alert the mailing list of any problems here and help us to keep on-the-ball.
