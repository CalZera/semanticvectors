#summary Compatibility between Apache Lucene and SemanticVectors

SemanticVectors depends on Apache Lucene, but not with all versions of Apache Lucene.

The current SV release, version 1.26, works with Lucene versions greater than 2.2.0 and higher, but not with the recent Lucene 3.0.

We are currently looking into this: it does not seem possible to write code that works with Lucene I/O classes for versions 2.`*` and 3.0. Probably we will ship a new version of SV soon that requires Lucene 3.0, while apologizing for the inconvenience to existing users.
