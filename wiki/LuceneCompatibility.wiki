#summary Compatibility between Apache Lucene and SemanticVectors

SemanticVectors depends on Apache Lucene, but not all versions of SemanticVectors work with all versions of Apache Lucene. To find the latest (and some older) versions of Apache Lucene click [http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html here].

SV version 1.30 and higher works with Lucene 3.0 and higher, but not with Lucene 2.X.

SV version 1.26 and earlier works with Lucene versions greater than 2.2.0 and higher, but not with Lucene 3.0.

SV version 2.0 works with Lucene 3.0.3.

We will try to keep up-to-date with new Lucene versions, please alert the mailing list of any problems here and help us to keep on-the-ball.

=== Other Packages Involving Lucene ===

See SolrAndSemanticVectors if you're using SOLR to build your Lucene indexes.

With [http://www.opensuse.org/ OpenSuse] there have been some problems getting the default Lucene installation to work with SemanticVectors. So far the advice is to go with a direct Lucene install - see this [http://groups.google.com/group/semanticvectors/browse_thread/thread/7d121625e96d08f6?hl=en_US# message thread].
