#summary Getting started with SemanticVectors.

This page is intended as just the barebones, and assumes that you are already somewhat familiar with using java at a command prompt. More help can be found at the InstallationInstructions page. 

Please note that our deployment strategy changed in December 2014, to use the semanticvectors artifact in the [http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22semanticvectors%22 Maven Central Repository].

= Installation =

All users should begin by installing java and checking that you can run java at a command-prompt.

== For End-Users ==

 * Download the latest Semantic Vectors jar file from the [http://search.maven.org/ Maven Central Repository]. This is currently [https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/pitt/search/semanticvectors/5.2/semanticvectors-5.2.jar semanticvectors-5.2.jar].
 * This jar file contains the Semantic Vectors binaries and dependencies. Make sure you run java with this file in your classpath, e.g., using `java -cp $PATH/TO/semanticvectors-$VERSION.jar`.

== For Developers ==

 * Install maven.
 * Create a maven project with the following dependency in your `pom.xml` files:

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>pitt.search</groupId>
    <artifactId>semanticvectors</artifactId>
    <version>$VERSION</version>
</dependency>
}}}

 * Build as usual using `mvn install` or using your IDE.
