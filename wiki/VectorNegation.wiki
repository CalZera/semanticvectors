#summary Sketch of how vector negation works, and where to find out more.

= Vector Negation =

SemanticVectors now has a vector negation feature. This enables the user to remove as well as adding terms from a query statement.

Vector negation works by projecting the positive query vector onto the subspace orthogonal to all the negative query vectors. It turns out that the same negation operator is used in Quantum Logic, as described in the 1930's by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann.
