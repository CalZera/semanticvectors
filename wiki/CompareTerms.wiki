= CompareTerms Tool =

This is a simple tool for comparing two vectors, which could be individual terms, query statements or documents. The javadoc for the API is at http://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest-stable/pitt/search/semanticvectors/CompareTerms.html

For terms, use something like:

{{{java pitt.search.semanticvectors.CompareTerms -queryvectorfile termvectors.bin term1 term2}}}

For several terms, use something like:

{{{java pitt.search.semanticvectors.CompareTerms -queryvectorfile termvectors.bin "term1 term2" "term3 term4"}}

This compares the sum of term1 and term2 to the sum of term3 and term4.

For document vectors, use something like:

{{{java pitt.search.semanticvectors.CompareTerms -queryvectorfile docvectors.bin ./path/to/Doc1 ./path/to/Doc2}}}

== Batch Comparisons ==

If you want to assemble scores for large numbers of pairs, consider using [http://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest-stable/pitt/search/semanticvectors/CompareTermsBatch.html CompareTermsBatch]. This tool caches your vector store in memory, so it's much faster for large numbers of comparisons.
