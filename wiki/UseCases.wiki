SemanticVectors can be used to find related terms and concepts to a target term. This application is sometimes called 'Automatic Thesaurus Generation'. For example, with the index built from the King James Bible, we get something like the following:

{{{
$ java pitt.search.semanticvectors.Search abraham
Opening query vector store from file: termvectors.bin
Searching term vectors, searchtype sum
Found vector for 'abraham'
Search output follows ...
1.0:abraham
0.6583164180237148:sarah

0.4339049483796074:shrubs

There are many ways of configuring SemanticVectors to use different [SearchOptions search options].
