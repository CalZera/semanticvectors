=The Current Flag-Parsing System=

==Overview==

Flags can be added to the FlagConfig class, they are automatically parsed, and can then be accessed from an appropriate FlagConfig instance.

The benefit of the system is that it's very easy to add and use new flags. This encourages people to experiment with semantic vectors, but it doesn't make sharing your improvements as easy and reliable as we would like.

==List of Flags==

See the [http://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest-stable/pitt/search/semanticvectors/FlagConfig.html Javadoc].

==Current Status (Instance Flag Variables)==

The code checked in version 3.8 makes a flag config instance rather than using global variables. This provides some more encapsulation, so that (for example) opening two vector stores with different dimension settings doesn't lead to a conflict. (Provided, of course, that the callers don't try to share the same flag config instance.)
