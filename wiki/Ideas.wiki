#summary Ideas and Suggestions for Research and Engineering Projects Involving Semantic Vectors

= Ideas =

There are many natural ideas and suggestions for things to try with SemanticVectors. This page is meant to be a starting point. Feel free to add new ideas or comment on existing ones. Many ideas start as discussions in the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/semanticvectors mailing list]. Some ideas turn into engineering tasks and may eventually be tracked at [https://code.google.com/p/semanticvectors/issues/list Issues].

== Incremental Indexing ==

This has been requested many times for practical reasons, and is a natural scientific question to ask of many of the algorithms used to reduce dimensions, and for learning in general.

Implementing incremental index updates for semantic vectors should be relatively easy: the algorithms would be fast, but issues related to file-ownership and thread-safety could be a pain.

So far, SV indexing is fast enough for most users, so incremental indexing has not been prioritized yet. Other pressing scientific motivation might arise from:
  * Dated / time varying corpora (e.g., analyzing the evolution of a news story over time).
  * Modelling narrative and discourse (e.g., a user session, events in a novel).
  * _Suggestions welcome ..._
 
== Ontology Modelling and Mapping ==

There are many reasons for investigating the relationships between semantic vector models and formal ontology models including taxonomies, conceptual graphs, Cyc, RDF, Wikipedia relationships, etc.

PredicationBasedSemanticIndexing results on Medline have been very promising, so extending these investigations beyond the biomedical domain is a natural step.
