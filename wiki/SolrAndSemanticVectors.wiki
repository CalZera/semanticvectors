[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ Apache SOLR] is an enterprise server search implementation based on the Lucene platform.

Some users have reported difficulty in using SemanticVectors in combination with SOLR. I haven't worked with SOLR directly, but one of the main problems seems to be defining which Lucene fields to index. Most SOLR indexes don't come with the `contents` and `path` fields that SemanticVectors is used to indexing and using by default as default document identification strings.

There is a plaintive TODO comment in BuildIndex.java, line 151, saying that we should make the fields that SemanticVectors indexes configurable. This would be a relatively easy fix with command line flags, though we haven't introduced comma separated list arguments before. A similar fix should enable the document id field to be configurable.
