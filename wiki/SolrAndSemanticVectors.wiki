(This article is a stub so far.)

[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ Apache SOLR] is an enterprise server search implementation based on the Lucene platform.

Some users have reported difficulty in using SemanticVectors in combination with SOLR. I haven't worked with SOLR directly, but one of the main problems seems to be defining which Lucene fields to index. Most SOLR indexes don't come with the `contents` and `path` fields that SemanticVectors is used to indexing and using by default as default document identification strings.

The easiest (and quite correct) way to deal with this is usually to set the `-fields_to_index` command line flag in SemanticVectors to be whatever field keeps your document's contents.

This should be sufficient to create term vectors, it may not help for making document vectors. I'll try to fill this gap soon.
