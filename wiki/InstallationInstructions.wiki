#summary Installation guide for semantic vectors package.

= Summary =

This page contains brief instructions for installing and running the prerelease version (0.8) of the Semantic Vectors package from the University of Pittsburgh.

These sketch instructions presume that you're reasonably familiar with Java, Ant, CLASSPATHs, etc. If not, you might struggle a bit. Better documentation will hopefully follow sometime soon.

== Prerequisites ==

 * Make sure that you have [http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/ Apache Lucene] running and that the lucene core and lucene demo files are included in your `CLASSPATH`.

== To Install from Jar Distribution ==

 * Download the most recent `semanticvectors-*.*.jar` distribution from this site.
 * Add the file (including full path) to your `CLASSPATH`.

== To Build from Source ==

 * Download the most recent `semanticvectors-*.*.tar.gz` or `semanticvectors-*.*.zip` archive and expand the archive (using `tar -zxvf` or `unzip`).
 * Feel free to check out the source code from svn and build using `ant`.
 * Optionally, you can unpack the jar distribution using `jar -xvf semanticvectors-*.*.jar` and compile by running `ant` in the trunk directory.
 * Make sure that either the resulting `build/classes` directory or `build/*.jar` file is in your `CLASSPATH`.

== To Build and Search a Model ==

 * Create a Lucene index using the Lucene demo, by running `java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexFiles` on the directory containing your corpus.
 * Create term and document vectors by running `java pitt.search.semanticvectors.BuildIndex`.
 * To search the resulting model, run `java pitt.search.semanticvectors.Search QUERYTERMS`.
 * If the upper case term `NOT` appears in your `QUERYTERMS`, the query parser will add the terms preceding the `NOT` term and negate all the terms after it. See VectorNegation.
 * To compare two concepts, run `java pitt.search.semanticvectors.CompareTerms "QUERYTERMS1" "QUERYTERMS2"`.

== Bilingual Models ==

For instructions on building a bilingual model from a parallel corpus, see BilingualModels.

== Vector Store Formats ==

The SemanticVectors package currently (as of version 1.6) supports two different vector store formats, a plain text format and an optimized format created by the Lucene I/O packages. For more information including format translation utilities, see VectorStoreFormats.

== Developer API Docs ==
