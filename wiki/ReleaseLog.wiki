#summary Release Log

=== Release 1.2 ===

2008-01-30

The main improvement is the redesign of TermVectorsFromLucene to use a sparse representation for the basic document vectors (basicDocVectors). These are now represented by arrays of short int values which list the non-zero +1 and -1 entries in a basicDocVector. The term vector building routine in the main constructor, and the generateRandomVector method, have been refactored accordingly. 

This change gives a major reduction in memory requirements, in one practical example reducing the RAM requirement from 7.3G to 1.1G for the corpus. It also speeds things up
further and should maintain the same memory requirement regardless of
vector length as long as seed length stays constant. Many thanks to Trevor Cohen for these  improvements.

=== Release 1.0 ===

The main new feature is the refactoring of the search code to use an abstract `VectorSearcher` class. This implements the main nearest neighbor search, but leaves the scoring function unspecified. This enables developers to quickly test new scoring methods.

Scoring methods implemented so far include cosine similarity and two product similarities, tensor and convolution. (This has led us to realize some features of tensor product similarity which should have been mathematically obvious.)

=== Release 0.8.4 ===

2007-10-30

At the request of one research user, added the `CompareTerms` class and command line interface to enable term-term comparison. Also refactored query vector generation, adding the `CompoundVectorBuilder` class which both `Search` and `CompareTerms` use.

Also improved javadoc.

User reported that everything worked - again good news.

=== Release 0.8.2 ===

2007-10-25

This was the first public release of the software. 
There were about a dozen downloads, and so far so good - no bug reports at all!
